# PriceGuard
A User Experience project that followed all the stepsâ€”from user research and interviews to wireframing, prototyping, and testing

With grocery prices rising by 8.5% annually (source: market data), many individuals struggle to maintain budgets. Rising grocery prices due to inflation are making it difficult for people to stay within budget   while maintaining a nutritious diet. Many people struggle to track price trends, compare costs across stores, and make informed purchasing decisions. Without reliable and easy to use tools, people often overspend, face financial strain, or compromise on essential groceries.
PriceGuard aims to solve this issue by using technology to provide real-time grocery price tracking, budget-friendly recommendations, and smart spending insights. It promotes responsible consumption (UN SDG 12) and helps mitigate the impact of inflation which makes it contribute to food security and affordability (UN SDG 2).
