# PriceGuard
A User Experience project that followed a complete design processâ€”from user research and interviews to wireframing, prototyping, and usability testing.

With grocery prices rising by 8.5% annually (source: market data), many individuals are finding it increasingly difficult to stick to budgets while maintaining a nutritious diet. People often struggle to track price trends, compare costs across stores, and make informed purchasing decisions.

Without reliable, user-friendly tools, many end up overspending, experiencing financial stress, or compromising on essential groceries.

PriceGuard addresses this issue by providing:

ðŸ”„ Real-time grocery price tracking

ðŸ’¡ Budget-friendly product recommendations

ðŸ“Š Smart spending insights

The app supports UN Sustainable Development Goal 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) and contributes to UN SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) by helping users make smarter, more affordable food choices â€” especially in times of inflation.
